/*
Create a function that prints "Done" after 2 seconds to the console.

- Right now use the sleep function to accomplish this, it is already provided for your convenience.
  
  The sleep function returns a Promise. It fulfills after the given amount of milliseconds, so this
  function basically waits N milliseconds asynchronously.

  syntax: sleep(waitingTime: number): Promise
  example: sleep(5000)

- Use the `then` syntax.
